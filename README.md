# FizzBuzz
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print Fizz instead of the number, and multiples of five, print Buzz. For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print FizzBuzz
This is a simple beginners code which prints values from 1 to 100 abiding by the FizzBuzz rules of the game. 
If the remainder of the current value is 0 when dividing by 3 or 5 then we know that it is a multiple of one of them or both, in which case 'Fizz', 'Buzz' or 'FizzBuzz will be printed.
